# 📄 Python File Handling — Task 1 & Task 2

This project demonstrates basic file-handling operations in Python, including reading, writing, and appending to text files.

---

# ✅ **Task 1: Read a File Line-by-Line**

### **Problem Statement**

Write a Python program that:

1. Opens and reads a text file named **sample.txt**
2. Prints its content line by line
3. Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist

### **Code**
[task_1.py](./task_1.py)

### **Example Output**

```
Program to open and read sample.txt
File opened successfully!

File contents:
Line 1: Hello World
Line 2: Welcome to Python
```

---

# ✅ **Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File**

### **Problem Statement**

Write a Python program that:

1. Takes user input and **writes** it to a file named **output.txt**
2. **Appends** additional data to the same file
3. **Reads and displays** the final content

### **Code**
 [task_2.py](./task_2.py)

### **Expected Output (if user enters 25)**

```
Enter some data to write into the file: 25

Final file contents:
25
This is appended data.
```

---

# ▶️ **How to Run the Programs**

Run the Python file using:

```
python filename.py
```

Ensure that `sample.txt` exists in the same folder for **Task 1**.
